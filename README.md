## Hello Hi 👋

✨ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software development student nearing graduation, passionate about coding and cloud solutions, with hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and cloud technologies. ✨ 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🎓 **Education**:
Currently completing my final year in software development at WeThinkCode.

- 🌐 **Cloud Skills**:
I’m AWS Cloud Practitioner certified, with experience in building and presenting cloud solutions, as well as troubleshooting technical issues.

- 💻 **Programming Proficiency**: 
Proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C#.

Knowledgeable in user experience and interface design, aiming to create user-friendly and visually appealing solutions.

## 💼Professional Experience:

🚀 **What I’m Working On**:
- 🏗️Developers Hangman Game >>  A terminal-based Hangman game and web-based Hangman game designed for developers, where students can learn programming languages. The game features three phases: Beginner, Medium, and Hard, allowing players to progressively challenge themselves. Players select a programming language, and the questions are based on that language. The answers consist of words with missing letters, providing an engaging way to reinforce programming vocabulary and concepts. The terminal version is complete, and I am currently working on developing the website version of the game.
- ✅ Quality Assurance >> Currently enrolled in a quality assurance elective, where I am creating tests to ensure software quality and reliability. This experience enhances my skills in testing methodologies and software validation processes.
